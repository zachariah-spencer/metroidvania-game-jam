Developed using the Godot 3 engine over the span of 4 weeks for a game jam.

This prototype showcases a metroidvania-style video game developed using the Godot engine. Players navigate a sprawling interconnected world with smooth room transitions, save/load features, a combat and spellcasting system, a complex player state system, 
and multiple enemy types. players must explore hidden passages and unlock new abilities to progress. Developed with an emphasis on code efficiency and modularity, the project serves as a robust foundation for further expansion and refinement, 
leveraging the capabilities of modern game development frameworks and tools.
